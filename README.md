# Raspberry Pi Pigpio Demos

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Pigpio Demos repository! This repository contains a series of practical examples and tutorials for programming GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi using the Pigpio library.

## Example 01: LED Blink

**Filename:** 01_LEDblink.c

**Description:**
This example demonstrates how to control an LED connected to a GPIO pin on your Raspberry Pi. The program blinks the LED on and off in a loop until you press Ctrl+C to exit. It serves as a basic introduction to GPIO pin manipulation using Pigpio.

## Example 02: Traffic Light Simulation

**Filename:** 02_trafficlight.c

**Description:**
In this example, we simulate a traffic light using multiple LEDs connected to GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. The program cycles through the typical traffic light sequence: green light on for 3 seconds, followed by yellow light blinking for 3 seconds, and then the red light on for 3 seconds. The cycle repeats until you press Ctrl+C to exit. This example demonstrates more advanced GPIO pin control and sequencing using the Pigpio library.

## Example 03: LED Chase Light

**Filename:** 03_chaselight.c

**Description:**
In this example, we create a captivating LED chase light effect using an array of GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. The program cycles through the LEDs, turning them on and off sequentially to create a visually appealing chasing pattern. The chase light effect runs until you press Ctrl+C to exit. This example showcases advanced GPIO pin control for creating dynamic lighting patterns.





Feel free to explore the examples in this repository to learn more about working with GPIO pins and hardware control on your Raspberry Pi using the Pigpio library. Each example is accompanied by its own source code file and a description in this README.
